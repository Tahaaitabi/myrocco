# What are we doing?
I need a database to hold useful information about people, places, services and potential businesses that my brothers and I can use to make decisions and record information about Morocco

# The data
The type of data that I need to collect is the following:
* Places and names of places, including their coordinates for later mapping.
* Land registries, or where to find them for enquires.
* Notable businesses in the area.
* Essential services that are not dodgy, such as; lawyers, accountants, leaders, community projects.
* Family trees to determine who's who.

# Consulting the data
The data should be accessed via a search-bar in which you can type in a query and all relevant information will be returned to the user.

# Language
Javascript, so we can use it as a web app through the browser on any device with access to one.
Will worry about making it into a mobile app later.

# Features
* Search Bar.
* Interactive map to display data points which when zoomed into or clicked will then be expanded.

# Modularization
This is a significant project which has to be realised in a maximum of 5 months.

I started this project on 21 days ago(25/08/24, 09:24AM).
